  <h1>Git and it's simplicity</h1>
  <p>There is a very good reaseon on why git is used all over the world, man, git's the most powerfull tool to those who want to build an empire on the internet development, oh, I almost forgot, for you to understand git you must learn the basics steps.</p> 
  <p>Let's talk about Git a little bit more...</p>
  <h1>Git's Workflow</h1>

  <p>You're welcome, this is git workflow in the easiest way imaginable! The Git workflow is divided into three states:<br>- Working directory - Modify files in your working directory<br>- Staging area (Index) - Stage the files and add snapshots of them to your staging area<br>- Git directory (Repository) - Perform a commit that stores the snapshots permanently to your Git directory. Checkout any existing version, make changes, stage them and commit.</p>
  <h1>Branches</h1>

  <p>Branch in Git is used to keep your changes until they are ready. You can do your work on a branch while the main branch (master) remains stable. After you are done with your work, you can merge it with the main office. I won't be using this for now beacause it's a time consuming process, but I assure you this is the *great* stuff.</p>
